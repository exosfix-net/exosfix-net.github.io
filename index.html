What: A collection of fixes for geared to help fellow developers & users of the latest OS X.
Why: The frustration level with "OS X & Co" reached productivity, intuitivity & common sense 
     danger limits, thus the site. For the $ amount paid for the products there are just too
     many bugs, issues and constantly forced to look for workarounds including work-arounds
     for the "apple way".
How: This is a community effort, there is no "fishy" thing here. All the solutions are based
     on github only, no "unknown" things are allowed to get into user's PC. The code for the
     fix is open to everyone and can be investigated anyone. The tool provdided (which is 
     also on github) to the user just automates the installation.
